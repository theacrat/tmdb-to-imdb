"""
Details of a credit for a name on a title. Distinct from Company Credits or Crazy Credits.
Successor to Credit type.
Denotes the role(s) a person had on a title.
Fields within this record may be aggregations or summaries of work done, depending on how the data was requested.

When requesting credits for a series, roles performed on the episodes of that series are rolled up to the series level.
Each rolled-up role comes with its own listing of the episodes that the role was performed on.
If the attributes of a role are not shared across all episodes, we drop that detail.
* Example: Kaley Cuoco (nm0192505) was credited as Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting for some but not all episodes of
The Big Bang Theory (tt0898266). When viewing credits at the series level, this attribute is dropped. The attribute
is still present at an episode level.

Characters and CreditedRoles for a series are ordered by most recent value first. This ensures a person's most recent
contribution to a title (and so the work they are most likely to demonstrate their skillset) is shown first.
This also helps to highlight the roles that users are likely to be exploring, particularly for long-running shows
where acting roles change over time (for example, Saturday Night Live).
Note that the ordering of these fields differs when using name.knownForV2 (see its documentation for details).

Appearance credits (such as acting and self-appearances) are contributed to IMDb's catalog as a single credit per title.
* Example: Ryan Reynolds (nm0005351) plays Deadpool and Nicepool in Deadpool & Wolverine (tt6263850).
This is different to crew credits, where a single person can have many roles on a title, even within a single
credit category.
* Example: Hugh Wilson (nm0933505) is both screenplay and story writer for Down Periscope (tt0116130), and these are
captured in the catalog as separate credits.

The CreditV2 shape maintains this distinction. For appearance credits, the individual roles played can be accessed
individually from the `CreditV2.creditedRoles.characters` field.

When a person performs different appearance roles across episodes in a TV series, we maintain this cast-specific
difference in data shape. All appearance work is aggregated into a single CreditV2 entry, with a single
`creditedRoles.text` value that includes up to 100 roles, and all roles available in the `characters` field.
* Example: Kaley Cuoco (nm0192505) plays two different roles across episodes in The Big Bang Theory (tt0898266).
This is vended at the series level as a single credit with one `creditedRoles.text` ("Penny/Penny Hofstatder") and
two character values (["Penny", "Penny Hofstatder"]).
Character names are ordered by their frequency across episodes, then by which occurs first in release order.

	Quentin Tarantino (nm0000233) was actor, writer and director for Reservoir Dogs (tt0105236).
	The Known For entry captures each of these as a separate creditedRole within the CreditV2 field.

	Within a credit, creditedRoles are ordered by the category of the role. We prioritise categories linked
	to the person's professions, then follow a fixed ordering of categories as seen on Title Full Credits pages
	on imdb.com.

	Within a category, creditedRoles are ordered by frequency of role (across episodes in a series), with alphabetical
	used as a tie-breaker. The same is true for characters on appearance credits.
	This behaviour differs from the ordering of creditedRoles and characters for other credits APIs (see CreditV2
	documentation). The idea is to highlight the work most frequently performed by a person, therefore capturing the
	work they are likely to be most recognised for on the title.

	shown together.
	For example, see Pulp Fiction (1994) in https://pro.imdb.com/name/nm0000233/credits.

	TITLE_AND_GROUPING: Credits are broken down by title and grouping.
	This reflects the same breakdown of credits seen on experiences like Name Main on imdb.com.
	Note that the credits vended would not be grouped or ordered per-grouping in any way.
	For example, for Quentin Tarantino (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000233/), we would return three credits for

	For a given Title, returns the Title's showtimes grouped by cinema and screening type.

	Notes:
	- Only cinemas with showtimes for the requested title will be returned.
	- If both lat/long and postal code are provided to `filter.location`, the location will default to using lat/long.
	- It's strongly recommended to explicitly provide startTime to avoid timezone mismatches between server and client, but if `filter.dateRange` is not provided, the startTime will default to the server's 'now' and the endTime will default to `3000-01-01T00:00:00Z`.
	- If `filter.dateRange.endTime` is not provided, the endTime will default to `3000-01-01T00:00:00Z`.
	- Backwards pagination is not currently supported.
	- If `fallback` is not provided, there will be no fallback logic applied to the response.
	- If `fallback` has `NEXT_AVAILABLE_DATE`  as it's value and the original result contains no data, the graphlet will attempt to fallback the results to the showtimes for the next available date from the provided `filter.dateRange.startTime` input value. If fallback results are found, the `fallback` results field will be non-null and provide information about the fallback result set.

	Sorting:
	- If `filter.location` provided, sorting will be in ascending distance from the provided location.
	- If `filter.anyCinemaIds` provided, the sort order will not be guaranteed. Currently, there is no requirement to support any sort for the resulting cinemaShowtimes, since the only use case we have is for a singular cinema, which will only return a single node.

	Errors:
	- Throws `BAD_USER_INPUT` with symbol `filter.location.postalCode` if the location is unknown.
	- Throws `BAD_USER_INPUT` if lat/long is too precise. See `LatLong` input.
	- Throws `BAD_USER_INPUT` if `filter.location.radiusInMeters` is null.
	- Throws `BAD_USER_INPUT` if both or neither `filter.anyCinemaIds` and `filter.location` are provided. Exactly one must be provided.
	- Throws `BAD_USER_INPUT` if both `filter.anyCinemaIds` and `fallback` are provided.
	- Throws `BAD_USER_INPUT` if more than 400 unique cinemas are provided in `filter.anyCinemaIds`.

	Limits:
	- `first` is limited to a maximum of 100. If the `first` argument exceeds the maximum, the results will be capped to the maximum.

	Vends name credits for this title, grouped into "Groupings" in a way that best represents a title's end credits.
	Actor and Actress credits are grouped together in a 'Cast' grouping.
	Archive Footage and similar roles where the person was not directly involved, are kept within this 'Cast' grouping
	(which differs to how name.creditGroupings vends credits).
	All other credit categories are presented 1-1 as groupings.

	Groupings are presented in a fixed order, presenting groupings in an order similar to that seen
	on movie or TV end credits. This field is suitable for building experiences that highlight work on a title separately
	across disciplines, such as displaying all credits for a title.

	When a name has credits on individual episodes in a series, these are rolled up and presented at the series level
	as a single CreditV2 value, giving a summary of their contribution. Details of individual episodes are available
	from "episodeCredits" on a CreditedRole within a CreditV2 value, or on the CreditV2 value.

	When a credit has performed many roles on a title, these are aggregated into a single CreditV2 value, with each
	individual role represented as a separate CreditedRole within the CreditV2.
	This makes this field useful for building experiences where you want to show each name for a title only once.
	For example, credits for The Office (2005-2013) (tt0386676) would include Mindy Kaling (nm1411676) once per grouping.
	All of their roles as producer (co-executive producer, producer, and so on) are vended as a single CreditV2 value,
	and separate values are given for their roles as actress, writer and director.
	Note that the aggregateBy parameter can be used to disable aggregation for specific groupings.

	Credits on in-development titles are only available to clients providing a Pro tier entitlement.

	Principal Credits gives the primary creative contributors to a title, organized by groupings.

	We group credits in a way that highlights the primary creative roles on a title.
	Showrunner, Creator and Head Writer roles are moved out of their original categories
	(typically 'Producer' and 'Writer') and presented in a separate grouping per role type.
	For all other credits, the grouping strategy on title.creditGroupings is followed.
	Note that we label the 'Cast' grouping as 'Stars'.
	Also when the TOP_CAST mode is used (see filter parameter), we vend a "Top X" or "Key X" text per grouping,
	replacing the standard text.

	The number of credits per grouping we vend is limited to 30, to reflect that most use cases
	looking for a summary of principal credits want a limited subset of data.
	For fuller data see title.creditGroupings.

	Clients can control the maximum number of groupings returned using the `filter` input.
	The specific groupings returned will depend on the title type
	(for example giving Showrunner for TV series but not for movies, and Director for movies but not for TV series).

	Note that the returned groupings may change over time, as our set of supported credit categories evolves.

	Principal credits for in-development titles only available when a Pro entitlement is provided.
	Without this, we only provide access to a count per grouping.
